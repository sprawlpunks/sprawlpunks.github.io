Sprawl is a port city for decentralised interaction. Person-to-person, and contract-to-contract.

Sprawl is a network, a toolkit, and eventually, a shared security foundation.

We believe the time is now for mass adoption of web3 technologies.

We want to solve the hard problems of user ergonomics in the space.

## What are we solving?

1. Addressability
2. Content layer
3. Web of trust and privacy

## Approach

Other systems have focussed on indexing and providing gateways into web3, but haven't committed to never leaving web3.

Our approach started at messaging, the building block of any true social platform. To achieve this, you need:

- Addressability
- Content storage
- Granular privacy
- Interoperable components

[More on all these points, and the wider philosophy of the project, can be found here](./pages/approach.html).

## Scope

Okay, that's all very lofty. What are we doing now?

We have a straightforward roadmap and will be building in the open on the [Sprawl Discord]().

Our initial roadmap is focussed on the messaging and addressability MVPs, and we will be launching our first testnet in Q1 2022 to start stress testing our first prototypes.
