Sprawl is a port city for decentralised interaction. Person-to-person, and contract-to-contract.

Sprawl is a network, a toolkit, and eventually, a shared security foundation.

We believe the time is now for mass adoption of web3â€  technologies.

We want to solve the hard problems of user ergonomics in the space.

## What are we solving?

1. Addressability
2. Content layer
3. Web of trust and privacy

## Approach

Other systems focus on providing gateways into web3, but few commit to building everything on the interchain.

Our approach started at messaging, the building block of any true social platform. To achieve this, you need:

- Addressability
- Content storage
- Granular privacy
- Interoperable components

[More on all these points, and the wider philosophy of the project, can be found here](./pages/approach.html).

## Who are we?

The Sprawl team is made up of core devs and contributors for other Cosmos ecoystem projects, and smart contract engineers. We have watched the space evolve and think we have something to add to the conversation.

## Scope

Okay, that's all very lofty. What are we doing now?

We have a straightforward roadmap and will be building in the open on the [Sprawl Discord](https://discord.gg/5HjBhrgx).

Our initial roadmap is focussed on  messaging and addressability MVPs.

We will be launching our first testnet in Q1 2022 to start stress testing the first prototypes.

â€  _though we use the word interchain instead. `internet -> interchain` has a certain ring to it.
