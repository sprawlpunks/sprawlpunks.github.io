### Addressability

A novel approach is needed to addressability. The mistakes of TLDs and DNS should not be repeated.

A new primitive is needed to address people and entities, as well as executable code.

### Content storage

Any computation system consists of data and functions. Smart contracts are the functions, but what about data?

We need a data model for dapp developers that can handle more than the ledger-style data that blockchains excel at.

Node operators will be incentivised for providing this storage, and it will be available to the chain and smart contracts.

### Granular privacy

The ability to reveal as much or as little data as you want, in highly contextual scenarios, is key for users taking back agency.

The ergonomics of this are key to the success or failure of the project.

This principle of ownership and agency is key to our philosophy. 

Sprawl is more like a consumer co-operative. The users own the platform via their economic participation in it.

Advertisers aren't welcome on the platform, and moreover, _they won't be needed by anyone_.

We will be bootstrapping the network by airdropping to stakers, not via traditional finance avenues.

### Interoperable components

So many of the primitives of the interchain are yet to be defined. A big focus of the engineering work is going to be portability of primitives, initially within the Cosmos Ecosystem via IBC, then beyond into the interchain.

### Hack the planet

Every user should have the ability to hack the platform they use. We started out with editors like emacs, and this is fundamental to how we want users to be able to interact with Smart Contracts.

In the 2000s, everybody worked out enough HTML to customise their MySpace page. 

We want to give users the ability to interact with the core of the platform, to customise their experience. That could be creating a custom interaction for their profile or minting NFT art.
