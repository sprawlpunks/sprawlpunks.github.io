### Addressability

We believe a novel approach is needed to addressability. The mistakes of TLDs and DNS should not be repeated. A new primitive is needed to address people and entities, as well as executable code.

### Content storage

Any computation system consists of data and functions. Smart contracts are the functions, but what about data? We need a data store that can handle not only the ledger-style data that blockchains excel at. Node operators will be incentivised for providing this storage, and it will be available to the chain and smart contracts.

### Granular privacy

The ability to reveal as much or as little data as you want, in highly contextual scenarios, is key for users taking back agency.

The ergonomics of this are key to the success or failure of the project.

This principle of ownership is key to our philosophy. Advertisers and corporations aren't welcome on the platform, and we will be bootstrapping the network by airdropping to stakers, not via traditional finance avenues.

### Interoperable components

So many of the primitives of web3 are yet to be defined. A big focus of the engineering work is going to be portability of primitives, initially within the Cosmos Ecosystem via IBC, then beyond into the Interchain.

### Hack the planet

We also believe that every user should have the ability to hack the platform they use. We came up with editors like emacs, and this is fundamental to how we want users to be able to interact with Smart Contracts.

In the 2000s, everybody worked out enough HTML to customise their MySpace page. 

Now, we want to give users the ability to interact with the core of the platform, to customise their experience. That could be creating a custom interaction for their profile or minting NFT art.
